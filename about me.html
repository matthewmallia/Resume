<title>About Matthew</title>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I’m a thirty-two-year-old Technician who is currently working at Malta Freeport Terminals and I am still learning about Web Development</p>
<p>As per attached <a href="./education.html">resume,</a> I have obtained the Wireman’s License A & B, a Diploma in Industrial Electronics, and good qualifications in the <br/>  
O-level examinations. For the time being, I am studying Web Development</p>
<P>At the age of 16, I got my first work experience with the TEC-Molds LTD company for the summer holidays, where I learned some background  <br />
    information on Mechanical Engineering.</P>
<p>For the past six years, I have been working as a Technician/Electrician in the Engineering department at Malta Freeport Terminals. In this role, <br /> 
    I have had to repair equipment breakdowns such as Tugs, Mobile Cranes and Cranes. This was done by reading schematic diagrams and <br />
    troubleshoot the problem in the time being. All of these tasks require attention to detail under the pressure of the production. Having attained <br />
    most of the career goals that I have previously set myself, I am now keen to expand my professional ability and to seek new challenges in new <br />
    fields on programming and Web Developing.</p>
<p>As far as my personality is concerned, I would describe myself as an industrious, diligent and associable person that enjoys working both alone<br />
     as well as with other people.</p>
